section01 complted.
we devided section02 in two part-backend and frontend. 
Backend-
Firstly we create a node.js project. Than we install express for creating server and api, bcryptjs for password encryption, mongodb for model and jsonwebtoken for access token. 
Than we create server.js file .
we create backend in three layers model, routes, controller. 
we craete user model with contraints. after the user controller (for signin and signup) and user routes we create user registration.
when we signup we register the user and when we signin we get a access token After that we create user model. than we create auth & user controller for get, update and delete the users.
Time to time I test my API by Postman.

frontend-
firstly we create-react-app by npx create-react-app.
than we install react-router-dom, @react-toolki, react-redux and axious.
than we create components folder, redux folder .
inside redux we create slice and configure store .
we create home , login, signup components and time to time we import many inbuit hooks.
i also work before little bit in this type of frontend project . but this time i dont know why where were i doing wrong at last i am able to create error free project.
